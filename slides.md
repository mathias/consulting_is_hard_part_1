# No really, consulting is really, really effing hard

!SLIDE

# Why is it hard?

!SLIDE

# Because it's not about how much code you can write in a day.

!SLIDE

# It's whether or not you're solving real problems.

!SLIDE

# Why this talk?

!SLIDE

# Bendyworks is a consultancy

!SLIDE

# You are a consultant

!SLIDE

## We thrive on solving problems and writing code.
## But we're failing if we show up to a project and only write code.

!SLIDE

## What we need is a method for finding & solving the real problems among:

* interpersonal, team, and culture problems
* changing requirements and business logic
* uncertainty
* failure

!SLIDE

# In the past, we read [The Secrets of Consulting](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0932633013) for book club

!SLIDE

!SLIDE

# We didn't all like this book, and we didn't all agree.
# But the conversations this book caused were very valuable.

!SLIDE

# If you weren't a part of that book club, then you missed out on a huge part of Bendyworks learning to consult.

!SLIDE

# So let's talk about some of the lessons from the first chapter of The Secrets of Consulting.

!SLIDE

## Fair warning: Jerry Weinberg makes up all these "laws" that are really just names and funny stories to help you remember them later.

!SLIDE

# The First Rule of Consulting:

> There's always a problem

!SLIDE

# The Second Rule of Consulting:

> It is **always** a people problem.

!SLIDE

# Pop quiz:
# Why do managers at companies hire us?

!SLIDE

> In the culture of management, the worst thing you can do is acknowledge that you have a problem that you can't handle yourself. If you really do need help, you need to sneak it in somehow without admitting in public that there is a problem at all.
>
> <cite>&mdash; Secrets of Consulting</cite>

!SLIDE

# Offer improvement

!SLIDE

# aka The Ten Percent Law
## If you promise too much, they'll never hire you.
## (It would force them to admit there is a problem.)

!SLIDE

# Make them look good.
## (Remember improv?)

!SLIDE

<h1 class="section-header">It's always a people problem</h1>

!SLIDE

# Corollary to the Second Law of Consulting:

> Whatever the client is doing, advise something else.
<p></p>
> People close to a problem tend to keep repeating what didn't work the first time.


!SLIDE

# Never forget that they're paying you by the hour.

!SLIDE

## This doesn't mean milk them for as much time as possible.

!SLIDE

# Corollary to the First Law of Consulting:

> You'll never accomplish anything if you care who gets the credit.

!SLIDE

# Make your partner look good. (Improv again!)

!SLIDE

> When an effective consultant is present, the client solves problems.

!SLIDE

# The Fourth Law of Consulting

> If they didn't hire you, don't solve their problem.

!SLIDE

## Never forget that consulting is the art of influencing people *at their request*.

!SLIDE

## Honestly?
## I think the 1st & 2nd laws are the only important ones:

> There's always a problem

> It is **always** a people problem.

## Keep these in mind!

<h1 class="section-header">Lessons from the field</h1>

!SLIDE

# Show value rather than arguing
* Remember: "Yes and" not "No but"
* Clients are a lot more receptive if you show the value of something rather than argue about the technical correctness of something. (I am very guilty of the latter.)
* Mic pointed out that a lot of time this can be accomplished by providing data. So have data whenever you go into a conversation to convince someone.
  * Data means anything you've got: prototypes, interviews, case studies, whitepapers; NOT JUST NUMBERS!

!SLIDE

# Sometimes convincing the client that one thing is better than another isn't the most important

* There may be other elephants in the room.
* You may be focusing at solutions at a micro level and missing the 20,000 foot view at the macro level.

!SLIDE

# They're paying as much for our culture and our values as they are our coding ability.

## If our culture or values are challenged (ie, "well, we don't want you to write tests"), then be assertive in maintaining our values. That's what they're paying us for.

# Learn who "The Ringer" is in any meeting
* Who is this meeting for?
* Who needs to hear what we need to say?
* Who is making a decision based on this knowledge?

!SLIDE
# Share only what is necessary

* Consider your audience (Does the PM really need to know every action you took on a pull request?)
* People can only hold so many pieces of information in their heads
* Leave people with action items
* Respect their time and their knowledge
